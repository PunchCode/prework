# Las Vegas Full Stack Engineering Pre-work

Welcome to the official PunchCode Prework. Here you'll find mandatory tutorials that need to be completed to be considered for the program. This can also be used as a great refresher for grads and newbies . While we don't expect you to be experts; we do expect you to be **familiar**. There is a lot of content to consume here. Get used to the fire hose! 👨🏻‍🚒

### Web Presence:

You should have a professional presence on all of the below platforms, as well as a professional email account. A personal brand is really important.

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com)
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Dev.to](https://dev.to)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com)

Another important aspect of communicating your brand on the Internet as a developer is being able to use Markdown formatting. Markdown is a way to write plain text documents that get formatted into html for display on the web. This guide you're currently reading is written in Markdown. Markdown is extremely popular in 2020 and as part of the prework, you're going to take some time to understand it.

### Accounts

We will use a couple of online services throughout during the class. Please create accounts on these services so that you're ready to rock on day 1.

1. Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com). Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your name.

### Basic OS X Skills (optional)

If this is your first time using a Mac it might slow you down at first. It's important to get as comfortable as possible with your laptop before class. If this is your first time using a mac, or you need to brush up on some of your basic computer skills read through these tutorials:

## **Know Your Tool**

Being able to code well requires you to be able to use your machine well. We&#39;re going to start with setting up your machine and then move into learning a few tools that are staples to web development.

### **Code Editor**

VS Code is our primary text editor and is **MANDATORY**. Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and play around with it to become familiar since you will spend many hours in this environment!

### **Command Line Interface**

Next up, learning what the heck the command line is. Dig in! You wont be the same after you learn how command the terminal. Work through this tutorial [here](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/)! Here&#39;s a [great tool](https://explainshell.com/) to decode some of those spell like chunks of texts you&#39;ve been blindly copy pasting into your terminal. 🔮

### **Git**

Git is used to track who changed what on files, as well as many other things. It&#39;s going to be one of your top tools, so bookmark the [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc). Now, work through [this](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) hands on tutorial, don&#39;t worry it&#39;s really quick. Now take a look at [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), it may seem a little advanced, but this is how we use git within PunchCode. This is how the real world works with Git.

### **Browser**

[Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/) (This is our browser we prefer for our dev environment.)

## **HTML &amp; CSS**

Below is a tutorial covering what web development is, what web development is comprised of, as well as how it all comes together to create web applications. The tutorial mentions installing Atom, don&#39;t worry about that. You&#39;re going to use VScode instead. 😉

Getting a good grasp of how to layout websites is VERY important. The course below is going to get you moving on just that with some cool new additions to CSS.

## **JavaScript**

JavaScript is where you go from being an artist to being a wizard in web development. A deep knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals will make you a highly employable developer. Complete Javascript Info to get a good beginner grasp of JS.

JavaScript is derived from ECMAScript. This is important since new versions come out having major impact on JavaScript. Read through this resource to understand the newest version of ECMAScript:

## **Capstone**

Build a website telling about you and include your favorite things and then push it to GitHub. Bonus points if you use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) to host your site.

**NOTICE: DO NOT USE A TEMPLATE OR THEME IF USING THIS PREWORK TO APPLY FOR PUNCHCODE. USE ONLY YOUR OWN HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.**
